# beginner 

learning github for colloborate with other projects

## Create new repo
I created new rep "learning-github"

## create README
This is the basic file contain in every projecct that contains text to describe about the project.

when we edit again this file 
the updated commit shows which one is change/ delete

eg:
- - with red backrgound line: this line is deleted
+ + with green background line: this line is added
- anything stay normal: that line is stayed same as in previous commit
